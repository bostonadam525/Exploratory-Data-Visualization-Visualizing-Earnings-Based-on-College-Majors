# Exploratory-Data-Visualization-Visualizing-Earnings-Based-on-College-Majors by Adam M. Lang
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis using Matplotlib and Plotting with Pandas. It uses a dataset a dataset of on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo. I scraped the dataset from the github repo and performed an analysis. 
Interesting findings included:
- It appears the top 5 majors that make the most money are:
1. Petroleum Engineering
2. Mining and Mineral Engineering
3. Metallurgical Engineering
4. Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering
5. Chemical Engineering
- It appears there are more Men with a Median salary between 40,000 and 60,000 with many outliers having a larger salary but the highest salary is only $175,000 and the range is between 75,000 and 175,000.
- Women make more money than Men with the highest being $300,000 and the outliers are between 100,000 and 300,000. The median salary is still similar to Men at 40,000 to 60,000.
- The Median income is around 40,000 which corresponds to an Unemployment rate between 0.05 and 0.10 which can be seen in the histogram.
- The Sample Size of about 4000 corresponds to the average unemployment rate of 0.05 to 0.10 where most of the variables are found.
- It appears the highest unemployment rate for the first 10 majors is in Nucler Engineering and Mining/Mineral Engineering.
- The highest unemployment rate for the bottom 10 is in Counseling Psychology, Library Science, and Other Foreign Languages
Conclusion:
Women make more money than men and Engineering has the highest pay reward with Petroleum Engineering bringing in the most. The average median salaries for both men and women with college degrees seems to be highest around $40,000. The Median Salary appears to hover around 40,000 with a standard deviation between 20,000 and 60,000 dollars.
